##### Ingredients

* a couple of potatoes 
* bag of spinach 
* 1 tin tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon of olive oil 
* 1 teaspoon of cumin 
* 1 teaspoon of coriander
* 1 small chilli (green)
* 1/2 stock cube (I used a whole one as what do  you do with the rest?!)

##### Method
1. Heat the bottom of the pan until hot.
2. Add cumin and coriander seeds and cook for 2 minutes. Open a window and extractor fan and be prepared to cough a bit!!
3. Scrub potatoes and chop them to 1/2 inch cubes
4  Deseed chilli and slice it.
5. Heat oil in the pan and add chilli and spices - cook for a minute
6. Add potatoes to pan, tomatoes and stock cube.
7. Cover and simmer for 30-40 minutes until potatoes are cooked 
8. Wash and add the spinach. (I slowly added it as it takes a while to shrink. And keep stirring during this time).

Good to combine with [mum's chicken curry](/mums-chicken-curry)
